Remove the claw mechanism by grabbing it from the back and pulling a bit to the left and then out.

Place all removed components on a white piece of paper and if necessary  
mark what they are.

Study the image a bit and get familiarized with the components and what they do.  
Also, this is a tricky part and it is easy to damage the sensitive components during the removal procedure.  
Take your time and use small precision screwddrivers. 
Remove the lens holder

Loosen the flap screw. 
![14](https://github.com/vintagefilmography/Sankyo_gatemask_removal/assets/48537944/3b9e9f4a-2261-4b9a-861a-3787dff19e08)  
Actually, do not do it the way it is shownn in the picture. Press with the finger where the screwdriver points and loosen the nut  
from the opposite side.  
![18](https://github.com/vintagefilmography/Sankyo_gatemask_removal/assets/48537944/62868d32-786f-4874-88c6-ee885fd8318e)
Do not remove the nut all the way. The little spring will pop out and dit is a pain to put it back in. 
We just need the flap to be loose so that the mask cover can be slided out.  
Remove the mask cover screws. Watch out for those copper washers and the flap stopper.

Slide the mask cover out.

Remove the gate mask.  
![21](https://github.com/vintagefilmography/Sankyo_gatemask_removal/assets/48537944/c15e21df-eecc-4da7-b9b0-3b9fa5396728)

Tighted the flap nut.
Mount the heat shield back in and the lamp mount.  
Lubricate cam bushings and install the felp pads back in. They go into a recess between the bushing and the mounting post  
not under the bushing. This could throw your cam alignment off.  
Slide the claw mechanism back in. Double check the image to figure out where it goes.  This one is a bit tricky.  
Do not force anything. The claw may bind a bit at the front. You can wiggle the assembly a bit to the left and that   
will free up the claw.
